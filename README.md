This is a training project for me to learn and master skills on technologies;

- Back-end: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), 
- Framework: [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/),  
- Authentication: [PassportJS ](http://www.passportjs.org/), 
- Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/),
- Template Engine: [PugJS](https://pugjs.org).

It's not important but I use [Jetbrains WebStorm v2017.1](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) as IDE.
